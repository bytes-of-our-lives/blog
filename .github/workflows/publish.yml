  push:
    branches: ["main"]  # The main branch contains production-ready content only.
  workflow_dispatch:    # Enables manual deployments for testing or emergency fixes.

# Concurrency

# Prevents race conditions with multiple deploys changing site URL references.
# Allowing in-progress runs to finish avoids broken partial deploys of live content.
concurrency:

# Ensures Hugo commands and shell expansions work identically across Linux/macOS runners.
# Avoids PowerShell inconsistencies with variable expansion in Windows runners.
