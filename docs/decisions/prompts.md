# Prompt Library üìöü™Ñ

This document contains the prompts we use to generate decision records and other content for our blog. The goal is to
create a consistent, helpful format that future authors and maintainers can easily understand.

> We may replace these prompts with custom GPTs on OpenAI in the future.

## Extracting a Decision Record

This is the prompt we use to generate new decision records with ChatGPT. It is designed to extract a single decision
from a conversation and format it according to our guidelines.

```markdown
We‚Äôre maintaining a set of informal, Markdown-based decision records for our Hugo blog project, stored under
/docs/decisions/. These records are meant to help our async team of trusted, tech-savvy authors understand **why** we
made certain calls‚Äîespecially when those decisions aren‚Äôt obvious from the repo itself.

These documents should feel like a clear, helpful explanation from one teammate to another‚Äînot like bureaucratic
templates. They‚Äôre practical, conversational, and tightly written.

Please extract **a single decision** from the conversation above and return the following:

- A **Markdown file** containing the decision in the format described below.
- A **short filename**, like `01-recording-decisions.md`, that captures the essence of the decision in just a few words.
  Avoid bloated or overly descriptive filenames.

# Format Instructions

Each file should include:

- A **concise, natural-language title** (H1) that reflects both the problem-space and the chosen approach. Do **not**
  prefix with ‚ÄúDecision:‚Äù. The title should be readable and expressive on its own.
- A short **intro paragraph** that sets up the problem-space and state of mind behind the decision, **without stating
  the decision yet**. It helps future readers orient themselves before diving into details.
- A `## Context` section that:
    - Names the problem clearly.
    - Includes relevant trade-offs and considered alternatives, when applicable.
    - Adds enough depth to inform a future teammate, without repeating anything or introducing bloat.
    - Uses a **conversational tone**, not a formal report. Keep it honest and grounded in our actual workflow.
- A `## Decision` section that:
    - States the decision clearly and directly.
    - Describes the chosen approach, including any formats, folder locations, or expectations.
    - Optionally includes a `### Rationale` subsection that explains the reasoning and rejected paths.
    - Merge `Decision` and `Rationale` if the logic is short and tightly connected.
- A `## Consequences` section focused on **practical implications for maintainers or authors**. Do not just restate the
  decision. Instead, outline actual gains, trade-offs, or potential risks to look out for.
- A `## Revisit` When section with **concrete signals** that should prompt re-evaluation. Avoid obvious or generic
  statements like ‚Äúif this becomes a problem.‚Äù Be specific to our blog‚Äôs needs and workflow.

# Tone Guidelines

- Be helpful and clear, not formal or bureaucratic.
- Write like you‚Äôre explaining this to a smart teammate who missed the meeting.
- Avoid rigid boilerplate like status markers, dates, or CLI-driven numbering schemes.
- Markdown is our native language ‚Äî use it naturally and cleanly.

‚ö†Ô∏è Only return the filename and Markdown file content (in a Canvas) ‚Äî nothing else.
