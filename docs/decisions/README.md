# ðŸ§  Decision Records

This folder contains lightweight, Markdown-based records of important decisions we've made about how we build, publish,
and maintain this blog.

These documents are written for **future teammates and maintainers**, including our future selves, so we can understand
the reasoning behind decisions that arenâ€™t obvious from code or config alone.

Theyâ€™re not formal, theyâ€™re not bureaucratic, and they donâ€™t require ceremony. Just enough structure to stay consistent
and useful.

## Why Bother?

Because memory is short, Git commits lack context, and Slack scrolls away. Writing it down means we wonâ€™t have to
re-litigate the same questions later.

We work with a small async team of trusted authors, and we want to capture the decisions we make together. These docs
give us a clear trail when we want to revisit or improve something later.

## Authoring New Decisions

All decisions follow the format and tone defined in [the first decision record](./01-decision-records.md). When youâ€™re
ready to add a new decision, create a new Markdown file in this folder and name it something like
`00-kebab-case-identifier.md`. Do read the referenced decision record first, as it contains important instructions on
how to write these documents.

If you're drafting a new record or backfilling an old one, you can use [this ChatGPT prompt][chatgpt-prompt] to generate
a clean starting point; it is ready to be dropped into a chat with the relevant context or conversation.

**Remember** to update the index below with the new filename and a short description of the decision. This helps us
keep track of whatâ€™s been documented and makes it easier to find specific decisions later.

This section should be updated whenever a new decision file is added:

2. [Power Our Blog Using a Static-Site Generator](./02-git-first-blogging.md)
