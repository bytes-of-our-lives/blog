# 📚 Bytes of our Lives — Tech Blog Repository

Welcome to the repo behind **"Bytes of our Lives"** — a blog about building, breaking, and occasionally fixing things in
the world of software development, technical leadership, and startup life. This space is where we turn our hard-earned
lessons into practical, witty, and insightful content.

We document not just what we write, but **how and why** we make decisions about the blog itself. From workflows and
tooling to publishing strategies and style enforcement — our approach evolves, and we track those changes [in the
`/docs/decisions` folder](./docs/decisions).

## ✍️ Contributing as an Author

We're a small, async team of trusted writers who collaborate through GitHub. If you're part of the crew, here's how to
get started:

### ✍️ Author Workflow

1. Clone the repo and create a new branch for your draft.
2. Write your post in `content/posts/yyyy-mm-title/index.md` (not yet defined).
3. Use Hugo _frontmatter_ and _shortcodes_ appropriately.
4. Add images or diagrams to the same folder if needed.
5. Preview locally with `hugo serve`.
6. Open a PR for feedback and collaborative editing.
7. Once ready, merge to `main` to trigger deployment.

### 🧭 Writing Philosophy & Voice

We aim for:

- A conversational, tech-savvy tone.
- Humour that feels natural — not forced.
- Practical takeaways, real-world war stories, and honest reflections.

Posts should feel like advice you'd give a peer over coffee (or debugging logs).

### 📐 Style and Quality

We plan to adopt [Vale](https://vale.sh) for automated style enforcement. This will help us maintain a consistent tone,
clarity, and formatting — but it’s not yet wired into the pipeline.

In the meantime, we encourage:

- **Using GPTs to help shape and refine drafts.** Whether brainstorming an intro, cleaning up clunky phrases, or
  rewording a technical explanation — AI tools can help emit more polished, uniform English.
- Prompts should preserve Markdown and Hugo syntax and maintain our preferred tone: thoughtful, punchy, and friendly.
- When in doubt, ask another author to review. We're here to help each other write better.

> [!TIP]
> Pro tip: clarity wins. Cleverness is great — but being understood is better.

## 🚀 Future Plans

We're working toward a more complete authoring guide, pre-publish checklists, and automation for preview environments.
Until then, keep things simple, and when in doubt — write it down.

Stay curious, write often, and remember to laugh at your own bugs.
